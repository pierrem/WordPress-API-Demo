# WordPress-API-Demo
A iOS application written in Swift, that demonstrates the communication with WordPress. The code has been kept simple and minimalist. In particular, error conditions are not reported to the user!
WordPress site URL is hardcoded. You can change it in WordPress Web Services.swift.

The Wordpress API is available for any WordPress.com site as well as any self-hosted (WordPress.org) site connected via Jetpack :
